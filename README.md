# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2024

Still javascript. It's a busy time of year and I just want to write as quickly and messily as I please while I ride the train home!

# Development
- You'll need [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.
- Make a new day:
```
./new.sh 03
```
- Paste the example input in `test`
- Paste the puzzle input in `input`
- Write solution in `/03/index.mjs`
- Test solution with
```
./test.sh 03
```
- Run on puzzle input with
```
./run.sh 03
```
